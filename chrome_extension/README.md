Entry for HackDuke Fall 2014.

Never be confused about a Coursera video again.  When you're stuck on a topic, this Chrome extension automatically brings up help from the Coursera forums, and only those threads relevant to the topic at hand.  The best part is that it's right there, next to the video, so you don't even have to navigate away from the video tab.

Never be bored by a Coursera video again.  Watch at 2x speed and never miss a word with this Chrome extension by turning subtitles into a Spritz speed reader.  Maximize your learning potential by reading as fast as you can.
